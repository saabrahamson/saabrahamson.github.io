  My name is Sara Abrahamson, and I am a junior at The University of Rhode Island. I was born on Cape Cod, and I am surrounded by two brothers and two sisters. As I grew up on the cape, I learned to love the water, in which included activities such as fishing, jetskiing, and boating. I am majoring in Criminal Justice, Applied Economics, and Computer Science. I value my academics as a high priority, but I am also involved in other aspects of campus, as I am a member of the Women's Ice Hockey Team, and on the executive board of RhodyTHON. I would like to make note that RhodyTHON is an organization that helps raise money for Hasbro Children's Hospital by fundraising through a Dance Marathon each year! Since I was young, I have had a passion for helping others, which has led me to aspire a career working for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). I hope to use each of my degrees to gain certain specialties, in which can lead me to help others in the surrounding community, but also worldwide.
