  My name is Sara Abrahamson, and I am a junior at The University of Rhode Island. I was born on Cape Cod, and have resided in Dennis since I was nine <br> years old. I am major in Criminal Justice, Applied Economics, and Computer Science. I value my academics as a high priority, but I am also involved in <br> other aspects of campus, as I am a member of the Women's Ice Hockey Team, and on the executive board of RhodyTHON. I would like to make note that RhodyTHON <br> is an organization that helps raise money for Hasbro Children's Hospital by fundraising through a Dance Marathon each year! Since I was young, I have <br> had a passion for helping others, which has led me to aspire a career working for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). I hope to use each of my <br> degrees to gain certain specialties, in which can lead me to help others in the surrounding community, but also worldwide.
